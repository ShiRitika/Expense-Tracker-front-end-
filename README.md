## Technology Used:
### For Front-end:
- React JS : React JS is a Javascript library used to develop the application.
- Reactjs Hooks: Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features. Because of this, class components are generally no longer needed.
Hooks used- useState, UseEffect, Redux.
- Material-UI : Some Material-UI components like Icons, Typography , MakeStyle, Button, Styled, Box, Card, Model, CardContent,TextField, DesktopDatePicker,LocalizationProvider ,AdapterDayjs, dayjs,ListItem, ListItemText, styled, ListItemIcon, Divider is Used.
- Javascript :
- JSX : Javascript XML is used to structure the page.
- Material CSS : MUI makestyle is used to style the page and make it more beutiful and attractive.
- Basic CSS: used to provide basic comfortability to website.

### For Back-end:
- Nodejs- JavaScript runtime environment and library for running web applications outside the client's browser.Node.js uses JavaScript on the server.
- Express - Framework of Nodejs help us to create a http server.
- Cors - JS Library allow us to share data between two different origin.
- Dotenv - module allow us to store secret credential of documents.
- Mongoose - Allow us to work with mongoDB.
- Nodemon- Allow us to restart the server whenever we make changes in it. 

## API
- In this project whatever data is used it is fetched from API url which was hosted on localserver.
- So first need to run localserver to get API.
- Run project(Expense-Tracker) available on github. URL for it: https://github.com/ShiRitika/Expense-Tracker
- open Expense-Tracker project go inside back-end folder and run the command on terminal "npm start".

to run project & get API

## APIs URL
-To get Income Transaction Data- http://localhost:8080/api/income.

## Fetching API
- RTK Query Tool(Provided by Redux ToolKit) to fetch API.
- RTK Query Tool :- one can easily fetch data from server without worrying about updating react component it automatically update it. It is advanced fetching & catching tool design to simplyfy common case & loading data in web App.

## What I've Learnt :
- About some material-UI components and how to used them.
- How to apply material CSS using makestyle in same js files.
- Setup of  React-js, material-UI installation.
- Setup ES Lint and identifying its error and resolving them.
- writing clean and structure code.
- How to use props.
- implementation of ES6 Features: Ternary Operator, Destructuring ,filter, Reduce & Map functions.
- how to use useState, UseEffect, onClick event handling, Button toggle etc.
- How to fetch data from API using RTK query tool(advanced fething technique).
- Creating nodeAPIs
